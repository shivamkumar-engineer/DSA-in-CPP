# 🧠 DSA-C++ Journey 🚀

Welcome to my **Data Structures & Algorithms in C++** repository!

This repo is a chronicle of my learning journey in C++. I’m actively solving foundational programming and DSA problems, pushing code regularly (every 1–2 days). It’s structured to evolve from **Programming Basics** to **Advanced DSA Topics**, all written in modern C++.

## 📁 Folder Structure

```bash
DSA-C++
├── .vscode/                  # VS Code config files
│   └── settings.json         # Editor settings
├── Programming Basics/       # Core concepts, syntax, and logic
│   ├── Functions/            # All function-related C++ problems
│   └── Programming Logic/    # Loops, input/output, basic problems
├── Data Structures/          # Will include arrays, stacks, queues, trees, etc.
```


## ✅ Current Progress

📌 **Phase 1: Programming Basics** – _[In Progress]_  
- ✔️ Input/Output and Arithmetic (`Area`, `Percentage`, `Sum`, etc.)
- ✔️ Looping Constructs (`for`, `while`, `do-while`, nested loops)
- ✔️ Functions in C++ (`SimpleInterest`, `VotingEligibility`, etc.)
- ✔️ Type conversions and basic logic (`Binary to Decimal`, `Decimal to Binary`)

📌 **Phase 2: Data Structures & Algorithms** – _[Coming Soon]_  
Will include:
- Arrays and Strings
- Searching & Sorting
- Recursion
- Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues
- Trees, Graphs
- Dynamic Programming

## 🧠 How I Work

- ⏳ **Commit Frequency**: Every 1–2 days
- ✍️ **Approach**: Write clean, modular code with meaningful names and comments
- 📚 **Goal**: Strengthen problem-solving, prepare for tech interviews, and understand DSA deeply
